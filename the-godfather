%

		-- Kay Adams, "Chapter 1", page 42
%
"Godfather, the man who runs it is a real .90 caliber PEZZONOVANTE. You can't

		-- Johnny Fontane and Vito Corleone, "Chapter 1", page 44
%
"Godfather, Godfather, save me from death, I beg of you."

%
"You blaspheme. Resign yourself."

"Mike is doing the job on her."
		-- Peter Clemenza, "Chapter 1", page 49
%
"You know who I am?"
		-- Vito Corleone, "Chapter 1", page 52
%
"I would work for you like your sons."
		-- Tom Hagen, "Chapter 1", page 52
%
"You trying to put muscle on me?"
		-- Jack Woltz, "Chapter 1", page 56
%
"Absolutely not. I've come to ask a service for a friend. I've tried to explain
that you won't lose anything by it."
		-- Tom Hagen, "Chapter 1", page 56
%
"Never get angry. Never make a threat. Reason with people."
		-- Vito Corleone, "Chapter 1", page 57
%
So Hagen started again, speaking in the most ordinary voice.
		-- The author's narration, "Chapter 1", page 57
%
"But please let me make myself absolutely clear. We understand your no is no.
Nobody can force you or is trying to. We know about your friendship with Mr.
Hoover, I may add, and my boss respects you for it. He respects that
relationship very much."
		-- Tom Hagen, "Chapter 1", page 57
%
"I won't take up any more of your time."
		-- Tom Hagen, "Chapter 1", page 58
%

important than they are."
		-- Tom Hagen, "Chapter 1", page 58
%
"In my case reverse is true."
		-- Tom Hagen, "Chapter 1", page 58
%
"Why don't you check me out with our mutual friend?"
		-- Tom Hagen, "Chapter 1", page 58
%
"If you reconsider, call me at my hotel."
		-- Tom Hagen, "Chapter 1", page 58
%
"This may be sacrilege to you, but my client can do things for you that even
Mr. Hoover might find out of his range."
		-- Tom Hagen, "Chapter 1", page 58
%
"I hope you can keep up the good work. Our country needs it."
		-- Tom Hagen, "Chapter 1", page 58
%
"Mr. Woltz suggested you bring an overnight bag and he'll get you to the
airport in the morning."
"I'll do that."
		-- The secretary and Tom Hagen, "Chapter 1", page 58
%
"I checked you out, Tom; you should have told me your boss is Corleone."
		-- Jack Woltz, "Chapter 1", page 59
%
"We can talk business after dinner."
		-- Jack Woltz, "Chapter 1", page 59
%
"I don't think you understand the situation. Mr. Corleone is Johnny Fontane's
godfather. That is very close, a very sacred religious relationship."
		-- Tom Hagen, "Chapter 1", page 60
%
"He never asks a second favor where he has been refused the first."
		-- Tom Hagen, "Chapter 1", page 60
%
"I'm sorry. The answer is still no. But since you're here, what will it cost me
to have that labor trouble cleared up? In cash. Right now."
		-- Jack Woltz, "Chapter 1", page 60
%
"You are deliberately misunderstanding me."
		-- Tom Hagen, "Chapter 1", page 61
%
"Mr. Corleone promises only to speak in your favor on this labor trouble as a 
matter of friendship in return for your speaking in behalf of his client."
		-- Tom Hagen, "Chapter 1", page 61
%
"A friendly exchange of influence, nothing more."
		-- Tom Hagen, "Chapter 1", page 61
%
"But I can see you don't take me seriously."
		-- Tom Hagen, "Chapter 1", page 61
%
"Personally, I think that is a mistake."
		-- Tom Hagen, "Chapter 1", page 61
%
"I understood perfectly. That's the Mafia style, isn't is?"
		-- Jack Woltz, "Chapter 1", page 61
%
In Hagen's world, the Corleone's world, the physical beautify, the sexual
power of women, carried not the slightest weight in worldly matters.
		-- The author's narration, "Chapter 1", page 62
%
"Mr. Corleone never lets his friends down."
		-- Tom Hagen, "Chapter 1", page 62
%
"If I pick up this phone, you'll spend the night in jail."
		-- Jack Woltz, "Chapter 1", page 62
%
The stupid, stupid son of bitch. How the hell did he get to be a PEZZONOVANTE?
Hagen wondered.
		-- The author's narration, "Chapter 1", page 62
%
"Thank you for the dinner and a pleasant evening."
		-- Tom Hagen, "Chapter 1", page 62

night."

%
"Pop, what's your answer going to be?"
		-- Santino Corleone, "Chapter 2", page 72
%
"After all, I'm not a man who does things rashly."
		-- Vito Corleone, "Chapter 2", page 72
%
"Write that down before you forget."
		-- Vito Corleone, "Chapter 2", page 72
%
"Then why do you come to me? How have I deserved your generosity?"
"I need two million dollars cash. Equally important, I need a man who has
powerful friends in the important places."
		-- Vito Corleone and Virgil Sollozzo, "Chapter 2", page 73
%
"No, don't protest. I'm telling you their thoughts, not mine."
		-- Vito Corleone, "Chapter 2", page 74
%
"All the members of my family have lived well the last ten years, without
danger, without harm. I can't endanger them or their livelihoods out of
greed."

		-- Santino Corleone, "Chapter 2", page 84
%
"Any of our people call, tell them to get me in my father's house on his
special phone. Anybody else call, you don't know nothing. If Tom's wife calls,
tell her that Tom won't be home for a while, he's on business."
		-- Santino Corleone, "Chapter 2", page 84
%
"If you wanta talk to me, get me on Pop's special phone but don't call me

%
"How is Freddie? He OK?"
"The doctor gave him a shot. He's sleeping."
		-- Michael Corleone and Peter Clemenza, "Chapter 4", page 91
%
"No, you can't. The old man would be sore as hell if I let you get mixed up in 
this."
		-- Santino Corleone, "Chapter 4", page 92
%
"You lousy bastard, he's my father. I'm not supposed to help him? I can help.

professional opinion. Personally I want to kill all those bastards."
		-- Santino Corleone and Tom Hagen, "Chapter 5", page 98
%
"Some people want to kill you, understand? But I'm here so don't be afraid."

twelve years old."
